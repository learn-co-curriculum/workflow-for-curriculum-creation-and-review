# Workflow in a Nutshell

All curriculum work occurs in Github. The lessons that you will be assigned to work on will be in their own individual repositories in the [learn-co-curriculum organization](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/) in Github which you will be given access to. You will either be creating the repositories yourself or they will already be created for you. 

When you're creating a lesson, **NEVER** make your commits in the master branch. Instead, create a new branch off of master and title it wip-master. Write your content in this branch, and when you're ready to submit it for review, create a Pull Request to master. In the PR, @ mention AnnJohn, our Curriculum Manager's github name. 

When you're working on a lesson that's a Lab, you will have two branches- master and solution. When writing your solution, create a new branch off of solution and title it wip-solution, and follow the same PR process as above. 

Your content will be reviewed by someone on the Flatiron Team and we'll make comments in the PR. When it's fully been reviewed, we'll assign the PR back to you. If the comments are minor, we'll tell you to fix and merge the PR. Otherwise you'll fix the lesson and then @ mention AnnJohn in the PR. We'll take another review and either merge or assign back with additional comments.


# Keeping Track of Work with Spreadsheets

We use Google Spreadsheets to keep track of all the activity that's going on in Github with curriculum. Here's a [sample spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DxZ_Iwnk9X6cMNrQBtVVgJnhsOezJ4ez2WTq7MX2ges/edit#gid=0&vpid=A2) as an example of how we manage curriculum. Take a look at the spreadsheet and read below for more explanation. 

In the spreadsheet there is a dropdown menu in the Stage column with various options. All curriculum will go through these various stages. Let's take a closer look.

**Define Objectives**: In this stage, either you or someone from the Flatiron team will be creating the learning objectives/ outline for the content. 

If you're defining the learning objectives, then in the Readme file of the Github repository, list your objectives and any additional outlines that will help flush out the structure and info to be included in the Readme. Once you've done this, we'll approve the objectives and will change the status to Ready for Assignment. In the Owner column, we'll add your name to all the lessons.  

If this is the responsibility of a Flatiron team member, then you can ignore any piece of content that's in this stage as it's not Ready for Assignment.

**Ready for Assignment**: The lesson is ready for assignment. This means that the Readme in the repo will have a list of learning objectives and additional notes on how to structure the lesson. 

If you've written the learning objectives, then you should go ahead and create the repositories (in learn-co-curriculum) and add the objectives to the Readme in the master branch. 

**Writing**: When you are assigned lessons to work on, we'll change the status to all of those to Writing. You may not be writing all those lessons at once, but this lets us know that it has been assigned and is in the process of being written.

**Review**: When the lesson is ready for review, change the stage from Writing to Review. Then create a Pull Request on your wip- branch, @mention AnnJohn in the PR, and we'll assign someone from our team to review the content. 

In the review process, the reviewer will usually have questions or comments which he or she will make in the PR itself. If there are no comments or issues, then the PR will be assigned back to you and is good to merge. Either way, the PR will always be assigned back to you and based on the comments, you can either merge it, fix and merge it, or fix and assign back for another review. 

**Complete**: When a PR has been successfully merged, you can change the stage to Complete
